    Number using O5 output only:                 6

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       35,636
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        10,876 out of  35,636   30%
    Number with an unused LUT:              13,510 out of  35,636   37%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      11,250 out of  35,636   31%
    Number of unique control sets:           2,112
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           4,282 out of 207,360    2%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
