MPICH2 example for multi-node cluster
-------------------------------------

This is a template for programming a distributed application in the AXEL
multi-node cluster. 

This example add two vectors, A and B, repeatedly and the result is
stored in vector A.

Parallelism is achieved by segmenting the vectors and distribute it to
the nodes.
