OpenMP example for Multi-Core CPU architecture
----------------------------------------------

This is a template for programming a multi-core CPU system in the AXEL
cluster. This example creates 4 threads each add the it's thread ID to
the sequence [0, 1, 2, .... N].

Parallelism is achieved by segmenting the loop using fork-join model.
